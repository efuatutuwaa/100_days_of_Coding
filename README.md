# 100_days_of_Coding ðŸ’»

Here I begin my #100daysofcode challenge. 
Everyday for an hour, I work on projects using skills acquired from studying Python.

Projects are as follows :


# Day One Band Name Generator

# Day Two BMI Calculator
- A program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m)

# Day Three Life in Weeks
- I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

[https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html)

This program uses maths and f-Strings and tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old. 

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

> You have x days, y weeks, and z months left. 

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
